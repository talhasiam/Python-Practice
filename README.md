#Using the range() function:

for value in range(1,11):
    print(value)

#output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
   
    #Python to start counting at the first value you give it, and it stops when it reaches the second value you provide.
    #Because it stops at that second value, the output never contains the end value, which would have been 11 in this case.
    #To print the numbers from 1 to 11, you would use range(1,12)
